# ForgeQueue 

### Distributed Job Processing Platform (Horizontally Scalable by Design)

ForgeQueue is a distributed job processing system that allows users to submit long-running tasks—such as report generation, file processing, or data analysis—without waiting for immediate results. When a task is submitted, the system returns a job ID and processes it asynchronously in the background.

Users can query job status at any time (pending, processing, completed, or failed). The system includes automatic retry with backoff for transient failures, dead-letter handling for persistent failures, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and idempotent submission to avoid duplicate processing.

ForgeQueue provides reliable, trackable, and horizontally scalable background execution through safe multi-worker coordination.

### Key Design Principles

-   Horizontal scalability
-   Strong consistency for job leasing
-   Idempotent submission
-   At-least-once processing semantics
-   Multi-tenant fairness
-   Failure isolation at execution layer
-   Infrastructure validated through integration tests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Core Features

## 1️⃣ Idempotent Job Submission

-   Composite unique constraint (`user_id`, `idempotency_key`)
-   Transactional deduplication
-   Safe under concurrent submissions

Guarantees duplicate-safe job creation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2️⃣ Atomic Job Leasing

Uses:

``` sql
SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

-   Prevents duplicate leasing
-   Safe for multiple worker instances
-   30-second visibility timeout
-   Lease expiration allows crash recovery

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3️⃣ Crash Recovery

If a worker crashes: - Lease expires - Job becomes eligible again -
`attempt_count` increments - Retry scheduling applied

Validated via integration tests.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4️⃣ Retry Strategy

### Short-Term Retry (Resilience4j)

-   Millisecond-level retries
-   Circuit breaker protection
-   Protects downstream systems

### Long-Term Retry (Queue Logic)

-   Exponential backoff (5--300 seconds)
-   ±20% jitter to prevent retry storms
-   Dead-letter transition after max attempts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5️⃣ Multi-Tenant Fairness

### Gateway-Level Rate Limiting

-   Redis-backed `RedisRateLimiter`
-   Header-based user identification

### Worker-Level Concurrency Throttling

-   Redis TTL-based counters
-   Prevents single user from saturating workers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6️⃣ Distributed Correctness Validation

Validated via:

-   Testcontainers (PostgreSQL + Redis)
-   Concurrency simulation tests
-   Crash recovery tests
-   Idempotency race tests
-   Executed automatically in CI
## 7️⃣ Observability & Execution Insights

On success:

- Stores result_payload

- Stores completed_at

On failure:

- Stores last_error_message

- Stores last_error_stacktrace

- Stores failed_at on dead-letter transition

Provides traceable execution history and failure diagnostics.
## 8️⃣ Performance & Polling Optimization

- Indexed polling on (status, next_run_at, priority)

- Indexed lease expiry lookup

- Short polling interval with bounded batch size

- Optimized for high-concurrency worker coordination

Reduces lock contention and prevents sequential scan degradation.

#  Containerization

-   Multi-stage Docker builds
-   Separate images for Core and Gateway
-   Docker Compose orchestration
-   Healthchecks enabled

Images are automatically published to Docker Hub on merge to main.
